# libc: invariants

Rules that must not be broken without changing this document and the
code together. Each names how it is checked today and what is not yet
covered.

**L1. Programs reach the kernel only through the library.** Every
system call a program makes goes through a wrapper in
`libc/include/cosmo/syscall.h` called from `libc/src/*`; no program
under `userland/` contains inline `syscall` assembly, and the only
program that names `cosmo_*` wrappers directly is `init --selftest`,
whose purpose is to check kernel error codes exactly (constitution
section 46). Check: review (`grep -r cosmo_ userland/` finds only
`init.c`). Gap: no build rule forbids `cosmo/syscall.h` in a program.

**L2. Headers carry the ABI, never kernel internals.** The public
headers include `uapi/cosmo/syscall.h` (the ABI shared with the kernel)
and nothing else from `kernel/include/`; `struct stat`, `struct
sockaddr`, `struct dirent` and `struct spawn_handle` are laid out as
their UAPI counterparts (`struct cosmo_stat`, `struct cosmo_sockaddr`,
`struct cosmo_spawn_handle`) and are passed to the kernel by cast, so a
change to a UAPI structure changes both. Check: `init --selftest` uses
`struct sockaddr` through the library and `struct cosmo_stat` through
the raw wrappers on the same kernel; review of `libc/include/`. Gap: no
`_Static_assert` ties the sizes together yet.

**L3. Every failure sets `errno` and returns the conventional sentinel;
nothing in the library exits or prints on its own except `abort` and a
failed `assert`.** `__syscall_ret` is the single translation point for
system calls; allocation failures set `ENOMEM`; `fopen` mode errors set
`EINVAL`. Check: `init --selftest` checks `errno` after every expected
failure (`EBADF`, `EPIPE`, `ECHILD`, `ESRCH`, `EACCES`, `ENOENT`,
`EINVAL`, `ERANGE`, `ENOTDIR`, `ENOTTY` through `isatty`). Gap: none.

**L4. The formatting engine never reads past its inputs or writes past
its output.** `vsnprintf` counts every character and writes only below
`cap - 1`; `%s` honours the precision with `strnlen`; `%.*s`/`%*d`
take their sizes from the arguments; the stream sinks flush a fixed
256-byte buffer. Check: `test_libc` on the host under ASan and UBSan
(truncation to 4 bytes, `NULL` with size 0, `%s` of NULL, `LLONG_MIN`,
unknown conversions); `init --selftest` checks a mixed format's length
and text. Gap: `sprintf` has no bound by definition.

**L5. The allocator never returns overlapping or misaligned blocks, and
`free` coalesces with both neighbours.** Blocks carry `size` (with the
in-use and big flags) and `prev_size`; every arena ends in a zero-size
in-use sentinel so `next_hdr` is always valid; big blocks (above 16 KiB)
have their own mapping and are unmapped on `free`; a double `free`
calls `abort`. Check: `test_libc` (64 blocks written and verified,
frees in alternating order, `realloc` growth, a 16000-byte request after
freeing everything needs no new mapping, a 100000-byte request maps and
unmaps exactly once, `calloc` zeroes, `malloc(2^50)` fails); `init
--selftest` (`malloc` 100 000, `realloc` to 200 000 keeps the bytes).
Gap: no randomised stress test; no guard bytes in debug builds.

**L6. `exit` flushes; `_exit` does not.** `exit` runs the `atexit`
handlers in reverse and then every stream's pending output before
`SYS_exit`; `_exit` and `abort` leave buffers unflushed by design.
Check: every utility's output reaches the serial log through `exit`
after `main` returns; the shell calls `fflush(stdout)` before `_exit`
paths it does not have. Gap: a program killed by `kill` loses its
buffered output, as on Unix.

**L7. `spawnvp` never executes a directory or a non-regular file and
never leaves `errno` unset on failure.** Each `PATH` candidate is
accepted only when `stat` says `S_ISREG`; the kernel additionally
requires an execute bit; `errno` ends as the last kernel error or
`ENOENT`. Check: `init --selftest` (`spawnvp("nothere")` is `ENOENT`,
`spawnve("/bin")` is `EACCES`, `spawnve("/etc/rc")` is `EACCES`). Gap:
`PATH` entries longer than 1023 bytes are skipped silently.

**L8. The library is single-threaded and says so.** `errno` is a global,
the allocator and stdio take no locks, `strerror` and `getcwd(NULL)`
use static or heap storage without synchronisation. Threads in user
programs do not exist (the kernel offers no `thread_create` call), so
this is safe by construction. Check: review. Gap: the day user threads
arrive, `errno` becomes TLS and the allocator and stdio take locks
before anything else is done.

## Gaps (documented, not invariants)

- No floating point, `<math.h>`, locales, wide characters or a wall
  clock (`clock_gettime` is monotonic only).
- No `fork`, `exec*`, `system`, `popen`, `signal`, `sigaction`,
  `setjmp`, `termios`, `getpwnam`, dynamic linking.
- `sockaddr_in`/`sockaddr_in6` do not exist; the native address shape is
  the only one.
