# CosmoOS

A new general-purpose, Unix-philosophy operating system built from scratch.

CosmoOS is a hybrid kernel with a small trusted core and modular privileged
services, a POSIX-oriented userland, capability-oriented security,
copy-on-write storage, an mbuf-based network stack, native virtualization,
and Linux ABI compatibility at the boundary. The project name is temporary.

## Governing document

Everything in this repository is governed by the master prompt in
[`prompts/`](prompts/). It defines the vision, the kernel architecture,
fifteen architectural invariants, coding rules, the development workflow,
and the phased roadmap. Read it before contributing.

## Priorities, in order

1. correctness
2. architectural cleanliness
3. observability
4. security
5. portability
6. performance
7. optimization

## Targets

- **x86-64** first, booted via UEFI under QEMU.
- **AArch64** designed for from day one, implemented in Phase 13.

## Development environment

The kernel is cross-compiled from an ARM64 Linux VM (Parallels on Apple
Silicon). QEMU is the deterministic kernel test platform. The kernel never
depends on Parallels-specific hardware and never runs natively on macOS.

## Repository layout

| Path | Owns |
|---|---|
| `boot/` | UEFI bootloader and boot protocol |
| `kernel/` | Trusted kernel core; `kernel/arch/` isolates all architecture-specific code |
| `drivers/` | PCI, VirtIO, NVMe, network, and storage drivers |
| `kernel-services/` | VFS, networking, storage, filesystems, virtualization |
| `libc/` | Native C library |
| `userland/` | init, shell, coreutils, system and network tools |
| `compat/linux/` | Linux process personality |
| `pkg/`, `ports/` | Package manager and declarative recipes (userland only) |
| `tools/`, `scripts/` | Host-side tooling and automation |
| `tests/` | Host, integration, QEMU, property, and fuzz tests |
| `docs/` | Subsystem documentation |
| `build/` | Build system definitions; output goes to git-ignored `out/` |

Each directory has a `README.md` stating its ownership boundary.

## Quick start

On an ARM64 or x86-64 Debian/Ubuntu host (the primary environment is an
ARM64 Ubuntu VM under Parallels):

```sh
scripts/setup-dev-linux.sh   # clang, lld, llvm, make, mtools, qemu, ovmf
make check-tools             # verify the cross toolchain
make                         # kernel ELF + UEFI loader (x86-64, debug)
make image                   # FAT boot image
make test                    # boot under QEMU, PASS/FAIL from serial + exit code
make run                     # interactive boot on the terminal
```

Other targets: `make BUILD=release`, `make analyze`, `make reproducible`,
`make test-crash`, `make host-test`, `make compile-commands`, `make help`.
See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Status

- **Phase 0/1 (done):** LLVM cross build, our own UEFI loader and boot
  protocol, x86-64 kernel entry with GDT/IDT, serial console, diagnostics,
  QEMU test harness, CI.
- **Phase 2 (done):** physical memory manager (zones, buddy allocator,
  page descriptors), kernel-owned page tables mapping all RAM with large
  pages, kernel virtual-address arena with guard pages and demand-zero
  faults, MMIO mapping, slab caches and `kmalloc`. Host unit tests under
  ASan/UBSan cover the buddy and slab algorithms.
- **Phase 3, part 1 (done):** ACPI table parsing, local APIC and I/O APIC
  with a generic IRQ API, TSC clock and LAPIC tick, one-shot timers,
  kernel threads with guarded stacks, a preemptive priority scheduler with
  a pluggable policy, wait queues, mutex, semaphore, completion, timed
  sleep, per-CPU data.
- **Phase 3, part 2 (done):** SMP bring-up through a real-mode
  trampoline, per-CPU tables and ticks, IPIs for reschedule, function
  call, TLB shootdown and halt, cross-CPU scheduling, a scheduler hang
  watchdog. Self-tests run on four CPUs under QEMU.
- **Phase 4 (done):** kernel objects and handle tables, processes with
  their own address spaces, an in-kernel static ELF loader, user mode via
  SYSCALL/SYSRET with SWAPGS, a personality-based syscall dispatcher with
  eleven native calls, validated user-memory access, fatal-fault
  termination, and an `init` program delivered by the loader. The user
  program's own self-test exercises every syscall.
- **Phase 5 (done):** kernel modules. A ustar boot archive (protocol v3)
  carries `init` and the modules; modules are signed `ET_REL` objects
  with a versioned metadata section, verified with an in-kernel SHA-512
  and Ed25519 implementation against a compiled-in key ring before any
  byte is parsed, laid out as three W^X regions in a near-kernel arena,
  relocated against the kernel's export table (`EXPORT_SYMBOL`, module
  ABI v1) and declared dependencies, reference counted for unload.
  Signature enforcement is on by default; RFC 8032 vectors and crafted
  ELF images run on the host, six self-tests load, call, and unload
  fixture modules on the target.
- **Phase 6 (done):** device infrastructure. A bus/device/driver model
  with resources and probing, a DMA API (no IOMMU yet, but no driver
  assumes virtual equals physical), PCI enumeration over ECAM with BAR
  sizing, capabilities and MSI/MSI-X through the interrupt layer, a
  block layer (`blkdev`/`bio` with synchronous helpers), an entropy pool
  and console sinks. VirtIO is the first real driver stack and lives
  entirely in boot modules: `virtio` (bus, split virtqueues, virtio-pci
  modern transport) plus `virtio_blk` (`vda`), `virtio_rng` and
  `virtio_console`. QEMU attaches a scratch disk, an RNG and a console
  whose output the boot test reads back; six self-tests cover the model,
  PCI, DMA, entropy, block I/O and the console sink (44 in total).
- **Phase 7 (done):** VFS and storage. A VFS with mounts, path
  resolution, vnodes and `struct file` kobjects (so the existing
  `read`/`write`/`close` work on files), a per-vnode page cache, ramfs
  as the root with `/boot` populated from the boot archive, a
  single-member storage pool, and cosmofs: a copy-on-write filesystem
  with two superblock slots, a two-level inode map, extent-mapped files,
  a bitmap allocator, CRC32C on every metadata block and a transaction
  model in which a committed root is never overwritten. Twelve new
  system calls (`open` … `umount`, numbers 11–22) and seven self-tests
  (51 in total) including crash consistency and a torn-superblock
  fallback; `init` mounts the disk from user mode.
- **Phase 8 (done):** networking. Reference-counted mbufs with
  clusters and explicit ownership, `struct netif` with one receive
  queue drained by the `netrx` worker thread (all protocol input on one
  thread, output on the caller), Ethernet and ARP, IPv4 with ICMP, IPv6
  with ICMPv6 and neighbour discovery, UDP, TCP (RFC 793 states, RTO
  estimation, fast retransmit, slow start, delayed ACK, TIME_WAIT,
  listen backlog), and sockets as kobjects behind nine new system calls
  (`socket` … `getsockname`, numbers 23–31) plus `read`/`write`/`close`.
  `virtio_net` is a boot module driving `eth0`; the loopback interface
  makes the protocol tests deterministic. Seven self-tests (58 in
  total) include a 1 MiB TCP transfer under injected loss, and the boot
  test drives the guest's echo services from the host through QEMU
  user-mode networking while the guest connects back; `init` exercises
  the socket calls from user mode.
- **Phase 9 (done):** userland. A native C library (`libc/`: errno,
  strings, an allocator over `mmap`, buffered stdio and `printf`,
  files and directories, `spawn`/`waitpid`/`kill`, sockets) and the
  first programs on it: `init` (runs `/etc/rc`, then the console
  shell), `sh` (quotes, `$VAR`, pipelines, redirections, `;` `&&` `||`,
  builtins), the coreutils (`echo cat ls cp mv rm mkdir rmdir pwd true
  false sleep`) and the system tools (`mount umount ps kill dmesg
  sysctl`), delivered in the boot archive as `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc`.
  The kernel gained what a shell needs: a console tty (line editing,
  echo, the UART receive interrupt), anonymous pipes as kobjects,
  `spawn` from an executable with an explicit handle map (no `fork`),
  zombies and `wait`, `kill` delivered at the system-call and
  return-to-user boundaries and in killable waits, a per-process working
  directory, `dup`, `fstat` on any I/O object, a kernel log ring and
  `sysctl` values (system calls 32–42). Three new self-tests (61 in
  total), a libc host test, the shell's own test script and an
  interactive harness that types at the `cosmo$ ` prompt through QEMU's
  serial port.
- **Next, Phase 10:** the package system: ports, builder, repositories,
  `pkg`, signing (constitution sections 47 and 48).
