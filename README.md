# CosmoOS

A new general-purpose, Unix-philosophy operating system built from scratch.

CosmoOS is a hybrid kernel with a small trusted core and modular privileged
services, a POSIX-oriented userland, capability-oriented security,
copy-on-write storage, an mbuf-based network stack, native virtualization,
and Linux ABI compatibility at the boundary. The project name is temporary.

## Governing document

Everything in this repository is governed by the master prompt in
[`prompts/`](prompts/). It defines the vision, the kernel architecture,
fifteen architectural invariants, coding rules, the development workflow,
and the phased roadmap. Read it before contributing.

## Priorities, in order

1. correctness
2. architectural cleanliness
3. observability
4. security
5. portability
6. performance
7. optimization

## Targets

- **x86-64** first, booted via UEFI under QEMU.
- **AArch64** designed for from day one, implemented in Phase 13.

## Development environment

The kernel is cross-compiled from an ARM64 Linux VM (Parallels on Apple
Silicon). QEMU is the deterministic kernel test platform. The kernel never
depends on Parallels-specific hardware and never runs natively on macOS.

## Repository layout

| Path | Owns |
|---|---|
| `boot/` | UEFI bootloader and boot protocol |
| `kernel/` | Trusted kernel core; `kernel/arch/` isolates all architecture-specific code |
| `drivers/` | PCI, VirtIO, NVMe, network, and storage drivers |
| `kernel-services/` | VFS, networking, storage, filesystems, virtualization |
| `libc/` | Native C library |
| `userland/` | init, shell, coreutils, system and network tools |
| `compat/linux/` | Linux process personality |
| `pkg/`, `ports/` | Package manager and declarative recipes (userland only) |
| `tools/`, `scripts/` | Host-side tooling and automation |
| `tests/` | Host, integration, QEMU, property, and fuzz tests |
| `docs/` | Subsystem documentation |
| `build/` | Build system definitions; output goes to git-ignored `out/` |

Each directory has a `README.md` stating its ownership boundary.

## Quick start

On an ARM64 or x86-64 Debian/Ubuntu host (the primary environment is an
ARM64 Ubuntu VM under Parallels):

```sh
scripts/setup-dev-linux.sh   # clang, lld, llvm, make, mtools, qemu, ovmf
make check-tools             # verify the cross toolchain
make                         # kernel ELF + UEFI loader (x86-64, debug)
make image                   # FAT boot image
make test                    # boot under QEMU, PASS/FAIL from serial + exit code
make run                     # interactive boot on the terminal
```

Other targets: `make BUILD=release`, `make analyze`, `make reproducible`,
`make test-crash`, `make compile-commands`, `make help`.
See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Status

The first engineering task (constitution section 70) is complete: the
x86-64 kernel cross-builds with one LLVM toolchain, boots via our own UEFI
loader and boot protocol under QEMU, initializes the CPU and interrupt
infrastructure, prints its banner over serial, runs boot-time self-tests,
halts cleanly, and is verified in CI. Phase 2 (memory) is next.
